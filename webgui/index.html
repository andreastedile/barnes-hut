    <p id="description">
        In physics, the N-Body problem is the problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of celestial
        objects interacting with each other gravitationally.
        Solving this problem requires the calculation of the contribution of all gravitational attractions that the
        objects are exerting on each-other. But this requires a lot of computational power, especially if there are
        thousands of objects.
        That's why a combination of Barnes-Hut algorithm and MPI is the best way of solving this issue. Our project will
        take care the 2D scenario.
